Project 2 - Card Trick 

Write a program to perform the following the following card trick.  The program 
must deal out the cards in three columns, row by row. 
  
        Ace of Hearts    Jack of Spades       7 of Clubs
          2 of Spades       2 of Spades       3 of Spades
          3 of Diamonds     4 of Diamonds    10 of Hearts
         10 of Clubs        8 of Hearts       9 of Diamonds
       Jack of Hearts       9 of Clubs     Jack of Clubs
      Queen of Clubs    Queen of Hearts    King of Diamonds
          7 of Diamonds  King of Spades       6 of clubs

The program must then prompt the user to pick which column his/her card is in.  
Your program should then pick up that column second, that is: pick up either 
remaining column first, the selected column, and then the final column. 
In the example above, assume that the selected card is the Ace of Hearts.  The 
user would select column 0.  Your program should pick up column 1, then column 
0, and finally column 2.  Then it must redeal the cards, which should look like: 
  
       Jack of Spades      2 of Spades       4 of Diamonds
          8 of Hearts      9 of Clubs    Queen of Hearts
       King of Spades    Ace of Hearts       2 of Spades
          3 of Diamonds   10 of Clubs     Jack of Hearts
      Queen of Clubs       7 of Diamonds     7 of Clubs
          3 of Spades     10 of Hearts       9 of Diamonds
       Jack of Clubs    King of Diamonds     6 of Clubs

Your program should repeat this process twice more (selecting the column, 
picking up and redealing).  Then the program must deal out the first ten cards 
in the deck and declare the eleventh card as the secret card.

Program Requirements 
Your program must generate its own random deck of cards using the following technique:
•	generate a random integer for each card 
•	display a string value for each card ("Ace of Diamonds") 
•	use the rand() function to generate integer card values 
•	use the srand(time(0)) command (only once at the beginning of the program) to generate a truly random deck once the program has been tested and runs properly. 
 
Each value must be converted to the format <rank> of <suit> as done in the example 
above.  Whenever your program displays the cards they must line up as they do 
above, on the word "of". 

Your program must deal the cards out by row and pick them up by column (3 times 
to make it work properly). 

Your program must ask the player is he/she wants to printout the entire deck 
before playing.  Each card must be printed out formatted as above.

Your program must ask the player if he/she wants to play again, and continue playing as many times as the player wants. 

The program must ask the player for his/her name and refer to the player by name 
throughout the playing of the game. 

Your program code must be logically organized using functions.
